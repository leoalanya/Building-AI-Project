# SpiritQuest
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
SpiritQuest is a comprehensive platform designed to assist individuals in discovering meaningful spiritual, religious, and fulfilling experiences that align with their unique preferences. By utilizing interactive questionnaires, writing exercises and your past activity, SpiritQuest provides tailored recommendations for practices, resources, and vibrant communities, both in virtual and physical settings. This platform addresses the contemporary challenges of spiritual emptiness and isolation prevalent in today's society.
## Background
Spiritual disconnection and the quest for meaning are increasingly common challenges in the modern world. The advent of the scientific and technological age have eroded traditional religious traditions, with mixed results. On the other hand, the spiritually curious  find themselves adrift in a sea of options without a clear path to fulfilling their needs. The fast-paced nature of modern life, coupled with the prevalence of digital technology, has led to a disconnection from traditional spiritual practices and communities.
## How is it used?
### Exploration and Discovery:
1. Questionnaires: Users engage in interactive questionnaires that delve into their values, interests, and spiritual inclinations. These questions help the AI system understand their unique needs. 

2. Reflective Writing: Users are encouraged to complete reflective writing exercises that encourage introspection and self-awareness. These exercises also assist the AI in gaining a deeper understanding of the user's aspirations and challenges.

### Personalized Recommendations:
4. Algorithm Analysis: The AI algorithm analyzes the responses from the questionnaires and reflective writing exercises to generate personalized recommendations.

6. Practices, Resources, and Communities: Based on the user's profile, SpiritQuest provides a list of recommended spiritual practices, resources (books, podcasts, videos), and communities (online forums, local groups) that align with their preferences.

### Engagement and Community Building:
7. Connection: Users can explore and connect with like-minded individuals and communities through the platform. SpiritQuest acts more as a launching path for spiritual exploration rather than the actual platform. Spiritual communities may be registered, but users are directed towards third party platforms such as discussion forums, social media pages, physical addresses etc.. 

Continuous Improvement:
8. Feedback Loop: As users engage with recommended practices and communities, they can provide feedback and insights on their experiences in the form of continuing questionnaires and writing exercises. This feedback helps SpiritQuest refine its recommendations and adapt to the user's evolving needs.

## Users and Considerations
SpiritQuest caters to individuals seeking meaningful spiritual experiences, regardless of their current level of engagement. This includes those who are new to exploring spirituality, as well as those looking to deepen their existing practices.

**Needs to Consider:**
* **Diverse Beliefs:** SpiritQuest must be sensitive to users' diverse beliefs, ensuring that recommendations and resources are inclusive and respectful of different spiritual paths.
* **Privacy and Security:** Users' personal information and responses should be securely managed, respecting their privacy and maintaining confidentiality.
* **Cultural Context:** The platform should take into account the cultural context and preferences of users from various backgrounds, offering recommendations that are relevant and respectful.
* **User Empowerment:** The platform should empower users to make their own decisions while offering guidance, avoiding any imposition of specific beliefs or practices. This is enforced by a diversity metric for reccommended practices and communities.
* **User Feedback:** The feedback mechanism should be user-friendly and transparant, encouraging users to provide insights on their experiences, allowing SpiritQuest to continuously enhance its recommendations and sensitivity to users' needs. 
* **User Education:** For those new to spiritual practices, the platform should provide educational resources and explanations to help users understand the terminology and concepts. This should include scientific and popular criticism of recommended practices and communities as well. 









## Data sources and AI methods
The psychological framework of the The Big Five model is used as another 




```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]
   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)
   # write your solution here
   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%
main()
```



Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
